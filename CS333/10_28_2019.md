## Scheduling 

Even if the job had been run before it is treated like a new job.

### I/O

- Adds the sleeping, or blocked state.
- When a process is in this state, the important characteristic is that its not directly runnable. It first needs to be added to the state list of RUNNABLE
- scheduler never looks at the SLEEP state jobs
- With interrupts we get parallelism at the hardware level
- We are able to get schedule compression, where we can ft more jobs or work into the same unit of time

### Priority Scheduling 
- Interactive jobs should have a priority over "CPU-bound" ones.
- Sort list by interactive
- Problem:
  - Starvation can occur as longer jobs keep getting scheduled to the back of the queue.

### Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
 - Multiple queue with different priority levels, the lower ones have long time "budgets"
 - If a job voluntarily give up the CPU, then it is reinserted at a queue at the same priority level.
 - If a job uses the full extent of its budget, it is reinserted at a queue that is a lower priority with a longer time budget.
  - In this class they will all have the same time budget.
#### Final MLFQ Rules
- if Prio(A) > Prio(B) A runs (b doesnt)
- If Prio(A) == Prio(B) , A&B run.
- Once a job uses up it's budget at a given level, it is reduced priority
- After some time promote everything to prevent starvation.
  - In this class we use one level promotion.

#### Note on complexity
- FIFO and MLFQ are both O(1)
- MLFQ better tracks jobs that change back and forth between interactive and long running
- Promotion strategies -- reset vs one-level
