### Layering
- Each layer relaies on services from layers below, and exports to layers above it.
- |Application
  |Host to Host conectivity
  |Link Hardware

#### Layering in Networks: OSI Model
This was the first attempt at layering in networks.
- Physical
 - How to transmit bits
- Data Link
 - How to transmit frames
- Network
 - How to route packets host-to-host
- Transport
 - How to send packets end-to-end
- Session
 - How to tie flows together
- Presentation
 - Byte ordering, formatting
- Application
 - Everything else

- Each layer appends more data relevant to its layer
