### Caching
- Total avg delay = Hit rate * LAN delay + miss rate * [internet delay + access delay + LAN delay]
	- Example from slide:
		`0.4 * (1000000 bits/100x10^6 bits/sec) + 0.6 * [2 seconds + 0.01 seconds]`

### Conditional GET
- Goal: don't send object if cache has up-to-date cache version
- Cache: specfy date of cached copy in HTTP request
- Server: response contains no object if cached copy is up-to-date: **HTTP/1.0 304 not modified**

### FTP: File transfer protocol
- Transfer file from remote to host
- client/server model
	 - **Client** side that initiates transfer
	 - **Server** remote host
- ftp: RFC 959
- ftp server: port 21
- Client contacts FTP server at port 21, TCP is transport protocol.
- SFTP is encrypted
- Secure sockets layer

### Mail

#### 3 Major components
1. User Agents
2. Mail Servers
3. Simple mail transfer protocol: SMTP

##### User Agent
- Mail Reader; Outlook, Thunderbird, Eudora
- Outgoing, incoming messages stored on server

##### Mail Servers
- Mailbox contains incomin msgs
- Messaging Queue of outgoing messages (to be send)
- SMTP protocol between mail servers to send email messages
	 - Client: Sending mail server
	 - "Server": recieving mail server
- SMTP: delivery/storage to recievers storage
- Mail access protocol: Retrival from server
	 - POP: Post office protocol
	 	- Authorization agent (agent <--> server) and download
 - IMAP: Internet Mail Access protocol
	  - More features
	  - Manipulate stored messages on server.
 - HTTP: gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo!, etc...

### DNS (Domain Name Service)
- Services:
	 - Hostname to IP address translation
	 - Host aliasing
	 - Canonical, alias names
	 - Mail server aliasing
	 - Load distribution
	 - Replicated web servers: set of IP adresses for the one canonical name.
- Why not centralized DNS?
	 - Single point of failure
	 - Traffic volume
	 - Distant centeralized database
	 - Maintenance

#### DNS: Root name servers

```
	| Root NS |
	 /       \
TLD's: |.com|  |.edu|
        /	  \
  |google.com|  |pdx.edu|
```

- Contacted by local name server that connot resolve name
- Local server gets name mapping from Root name server
#### TLD servers
- responsible for com, org, net, edu, etc, top level country domains
- **Network Solutions** maintains servers for com TLD
- **Educase** for edu TLD

#### DNS name resolution example
- Host at cis.poly.edu wants IP address for gaia.cs.umass.edu
- **Iterate Query**
	- Contacted server replies with name of server to contact
 	- "I don't know this name, but ask this server"
- **Recursive Query**
 	- Puts burden of name reolution on contacted name server
 	- Heavy load?
#### DNS: caching and updating records
- Once (any) name server learns mapping, it caches it.

#### DNS Records
- Distributed db storing resource records (RR)
- RR format: (name, value, type, ttl)
- Type=A
 	- name is hostname
 	- value is IP address
- Type=NS
 	- name is domain
 	- value is hostname of authoritative name server for this domain
- Type=CNAME
 	- name is alias name for some "canonical" (the real) name
 	- value is canonical name.
- Type=MX
 	- value is name of mailserver associated with that name.
