# Scheduling:

## Batch running -- early method to run instructions and schedule processes on the CPU. There is no scheduler, it just runs whatever is entered into it.

## Initial Constraints:
- These represent constraints on early systems and systems today
1. Each job finishes within the same time period.
2. All jobs arrive at the same time.
3. Each job runs to completion once scheduled.
4. No I/O
5. Run time for each job as known a priori. The CPU knows how much CPU time needed to complete it.

- As systems modernized some of these constraints were relaxed.
- First come fist serve (FCFS) scheduling is optimal when all 5 constraints hold.
