### Dynamic Routing Protocols
- Distance vector protocols send their entire routing table to directly connected neighbors.
	- Distance vector protocols have slow convergence and suffer from the count-to-infinity problem details of which you can find here.
- Link state protocols send information about directly connected links to all the routers in the network.
	- Link state routing protocols are widely used in large networks due to their fast convergence and high reliability.

### RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- Distance-Vector Algorithm
	- Metric: # of hops (max = 15 hops) each link has cost 1
	- DV's exchanged with neighbors every 30 seconds in response message (aka **Adverstisement**)
	- Each Advertisement list of up to 25 destination subnets ( in IP addressing sense)

### OSPF (Open SHortest PAth First)
- "Open" publicly available
- Uses Link-state algorithm
	- LS packet dissementation
- NOt in RIP:
	- Security:
		- All OSPF messages authenticated
		- Multiple same cost paths allowed (only 1 path in RIP)

### BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
- De facto inter-domain routing protocol
- Provides each AS a means to:
	- eBGP:
		- Obtain subnet reachability info from all neighboring AS-internal routers
	- iBGP:
		- Propagate reachability information to all AS-internal routers
- BGP BASICS:
	- 2 BGP routers start a session to exchange BGP msgs
	- Advertising paths to different desination network prefixes ("Path vector" protocol)
	- Exchanged over semi-permanent TCP connections
- Selects route based on 4 things:
1. Local preference value attribute: policy decision
