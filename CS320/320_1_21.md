## Constructed types
- Products -- Tuples, records, structs, arrays
- Sums -- Variants, Unions
- Recursion
- Functions
- Parameterization
- Polymorphism

#### Product Types
- Allows us to package multiple values as a single composite or aggregate value
- DIfferent languages support different notions of product types...
	- Access methods: names, numbered, positional
	- Fixed size VS. Extensible
	- Homogeneous VS. Heterogeneous content types
- Records/structs/classes
	- **Tuples** -- collection of values accessed by position
		- Different fields can have different types of values.
		- Constant time access to each field.
	- **Array** -- Collection of values accessed by position/index
		- Consant time access.
		- Typically, values have the same type.
		- array indexing a[n] - n is multiplied by size of elements in memory to arrive correctly.
	- **Dictionaries/Generalized arrays**
		- In python, Dicts are not restricted to integer indices.
		- Keys are generated at runtime: ages['bob'] = 75
